## Overview
The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between a person's weight and height using a simple linear regression model. We visualize the data, preprocess it, train a linear regression model, and evaluate its performance using various metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `weight-height.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- `Height`: Height of the person (in inches).
- `Weight`: Weight of the person (in pounds).

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
